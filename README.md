## Steps ##
1.   We read the dataset
2.   Apply EDA on the dataset
3.   Label Encoding
4.   Visualize the data
5.   Model building
6.   Hyper parameter tuning
7.   Model Evaluation

## Basic Ajanda

In this project we are going to work on telecom Industry Data, Using the existing no of features we build a model that predicts whether the customer
is a churned customer or not. So this is a classification problem, Here first of all we apply EDA after the EDA part is complete we visualize the data
after visualization we build the model and predict the churn customer.
